## Validate Stack Sequences
*Given two sequences pushed and popped with distinct values, return true if and only if this could have been the result of a sequence of push and pop operations on an initially empty stack. This is from https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-stack-sequences/*

##  Binary Search Tree Iterator
*Implement an iterator over a binary search tree (BST). Your iterator will be initialized with the root node of a BST. Calling next() will return the next smallest number in the BST. This is from https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search-tree-iterator/*


##  Split Linked List in Parts
*Given a (singly) linked list with head node root, write a function to split the linked list into k consecutive linked list "parts".
The length of each part should be as equal as possible: no two parts should have a size differing by more than 1. This may lead to some parts being null.
The parts should be in order of occurrence in the input list, and parts occurring earlier should always have a size greater than or equal parts occurring later. This is from https://leetcode.com/problems/split-linked-list-in-parts/*
