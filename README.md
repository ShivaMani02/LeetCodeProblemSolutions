## Validate Stack Sequences
*Given two sequences pushed and popped with distinct values, return true if and only if this could have been the result of a sequence of push and pop operations on an initially empty stack. This is from https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-stack-sequences/*

## Next Greater Element I
*You are given two arrays (without duplicates) nums1 and nums2 where nums1â€™s elements are subset of nums2. Find all the next greater numbers for nums1's elements in the corresponding places of nums2. The Next Greater Number of a number x in nums1 is the first greater number to its right in nums2. If it does not exist, output -1 for this number.. This is from https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-i/*
